# Immersive Ground Markers
Tired of bright yellow squares to help you remember where to stand? Why not have a pile of bones or a nice little star there instead?
Place and spin any prop you want as a marker on the ground to keep your boss rooms looking clean and immersive while still helping your remember those tiles that save you during the fight.
Improved placement coming soon...
